# Minicurso MicroPython com IoT
## SECOMP 2018
UFES-Alegre, 17/10/2018

Apresentadores : Nélio Gonçalves Godoi, Roberto Colistete Jr.

[**MicroPython**](http://micropython.org/) is a free and open source implementation of Python 3 optimised to run on a microcontroller with MHz and tens of Kbytes of RAM, giving a low-level Python operating system running interactive prompt or scripts.

MicroPython microcontroller boards have many electronic interfaces : digital input/output (GPIO) ports, analog inputs (via Analog Digital Converter - ADC), analog outputs (via Digital to Analog Converter - ADC), wireless (WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa, SigFox, etc), etc. So MicroPython on microcontroller boards can be used to control all kinds of electronic and IoT (Internet of Things) projects.

The presenters will bring 17 kits (for 17 attendees), each one composed of :
- 1 microcontroller board ([LoPy4 from Pycom](https://pycom.io/hardware/lopy4-specs/)) with WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa and SigFox with MicroPython installed;
- 1 [Expansion Board](https://pycom.io/product/expansion-board-3-0/);
- 1 pressure/humidity/temperature I2C sensor, [BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/bme280);
- jumper cables.

Learning goals from attendees point of view :
- know the features of MicroPython;
- have the oportunity to taste MicroPython on a real microcontroller board;
- practice MicroPython in interactive mode and using script files;
- connect and read sensors using MicroPython;
- practice with some MicroPython scientific modules to process sensor data;
- publish sensor data on local web server;
- practice LoRa, with many nodes sending data to a LoRa-MAC gateway.
